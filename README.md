# Ney notes
Illustrate how to play various musical notes on the [ney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_ney).

The repository simply consists of a single web page which allows the user to see how to play several music notes on the ney.
You can type several musical notes and see the corresponding fingering while typing.

The web page supports a single sheet which can contain multiple phrases. Each phrase contains an input text field which
allows the user to type in a sequence of music notes. Right now the supported musical notes are:
```
G, A, A#, B, C, C#, D, hD, hEb, hE, hF, hF#, hG, hAb, hA, hhB, hhC, hhC#, hhD
```

After having typed phrases and notes the sheet can be bookmarked since all the data gets base64 encoded and is added
to the URL after the hash as well.
